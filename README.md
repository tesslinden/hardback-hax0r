## TODOs
* fix bug where website breaks if you hit search before entering any inputs
* shouldn't have to click "add letter" for first letter. Maybe have 5 letter inputs there by default.
* throw error if adding more than 26 letters
* clearer error messages for duplicate or invalid letter entry
* split webpage into 3 columns: letter counts; min length and max length inputs; search results
* Add button to remove letter
* Add button to clear all inputs, and ask user to confirm
* Add button to download results as text file
* Convert words.txt to SQL database and query it
* For each word, try pinging wiktionary and if it doesn't work then filter it out
* Paginate results if there are more than 100
