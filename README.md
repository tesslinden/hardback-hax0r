## TODOs
* show number of words found
* show search query below "Search results" header and above results, e.g.: "query: 4 a, 3 b, min length 1"
* shouldn't have to click "add letter" for first letter. Maybe have 5 letter inputs there by default.
* throw error if adding more than 26 letters
* clearer error messages for duplicate or invalid letter entry
* split webpage into 3 columns: letter counts; min length and max length inputs; search results
* Add button to remove letter
* Add button to clear all inputs, and ask user to confirm
* Add button to download results as text file
